sample_groups: [A, B, C] #Fill with comma separated list of group names, must be identical to the groups in generate_kmers.sh script, case sensitive.
input_files: [A.fasta, B.fasta, C.fasta] #Fill with comma separated list of fasta files with input sequences. There should be one file per group and the order must match with sample_groups.
header_format: [] #Optionally, fill with comma separated list of header formats of fasta files above. Accepts values of "gisaid", "ncbi" or "plain". If left empty assumes "plain" for all groups.
mode: ava #"ava" or "ovr" for all vs all or one vs rest comparison. If ovr, input the group of interest in the next line
goi: #Define group of interest for ovr mode.
